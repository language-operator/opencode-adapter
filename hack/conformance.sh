#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Run the coding-runtime conformance suite against an adapter image.
#
# The suite lives upstream and is fetched at the tag the Dockerfile pins. The
# whole test/ directory comes down, not just conformance.sh: the terminal
# round-trip check bind-mounts a probe out of test/fixture-adapter/, and against
# a missing path Docker helpfully creates an empty directory, so the check fails
# for a reason that has nothing to do with the image.
#
# One check in adapter mode cannot pass for a TUI adapter. "a keystroke
# round-trips through tmux" types `echo CONFORMANCE_TERMINAL""_OK` and waits for
# a *shell* to reconstitute the marker — the quotes are deliberate, so that an
# echo of the keystrokes alone cannot satisfy it. Our terminal runs the opencode
# TUI, which puts typed text in its prompt rather than executing it, so the
# marker never appears. The probe sits in test/fixture-adapter/ beside a bash
# launcher, and the upstream authoring guide describes adapter mode as "uid,
# read-only rootfs, probes, and the cross-origin guard" without mentioning it:
# the check belongs to the fixture, not to every adapter built on the base.
#
# So it is tolerated — by name, and nothing else is. Any other failure fails the
# run, as does this one disappearing: if the suite starts passing outright, the
# tolerance below has outlived the upstream limitation and should be deleted.
