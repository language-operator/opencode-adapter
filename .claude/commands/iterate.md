# Iterate: do the next logical piece of work

One run handles **one issue**, from selection to a merged PR and a closed issue, then stops.
For continuous work, use `/loop /iterate` or a scheduled agent.

## Context

Read:
- `CLAUDE.md`
- `README.md`
- `.claude/MEMORY.md`, if it exists

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` may contain:
- *(nothing)*: pick the next issue (see below).
- `#N` or `N`: work issue N.
- `--auto`: unattended mode (see step 4).

## Picking the next issue

```bash
gh issue list --state open --limit 500 --json number,title,labels,createdAt --jq '
  map(select([.labels[].name] | (index("in-progress") or index("question")) | not))
  | map(. + {rank: ([.labels[].name] as $l |
      if $l | index("ready") then 0
      elif $l | index("bug") then 1
      elif $l | index("enhancement") then 2
      elif ($l | index("tech-debt")) or ($l | index("documentation")) then 3
      else 4 end)})
  | sort_by(.rank, .createdAt) | first // empty'
```

This skips issues labelled `in-progress` or `question`, then takes the first match in order: `ready` (set by `/prioritize`), `bug`, `enhancement`, `tech-debt`/`documentation`, everything else; oldest first within a group. If the output is empty, report idle and stop.

## Steps

1. **Select** the issue, either as above or from `#N`. If it's closed or not found, report and stop. Read the body and comments: `gh issue view <N> --comments`.
2. **Validate.** If the issue is invalid, a duplicate or out of date, comment why, close it, and go back to step 1. (With `#N`, stop instead.)
3. **Claim** the issue. Pick a short slug (2–4 words) from the title, then:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/commands/iterate/start-issue.sh <N> <short-slug>
   ```
   - The script adds `in-progress` (creating the label if the repo lacks it) before creating the worktree.
   - If it exits non-zero because the issue is already `in-progress`, go back to step 1 (with `#N`, stop).
   - It prints `worktree:<path>`. `cd` into that path and stay there for the rest of the run.
4. **Plan.** The run is unattended only if `$ARGUMENTS` contains `--auto`. A scheduled or task-mode agent should pass it; `AGENT_NAME` must not be used for this, because the operator sets it in *every* agent pod and those agents are interactive by design — the terminal is the whole point — so it is also set when someone is watching.
   - Interactive: enter plan mode, propose the plan, and wait for approval.
   - Unattended: post the plan as a comment (`gh issue comment <N> --body "<plan>"`) and continue.
5. **Implement** the plan inside the worktree.
6. **Test**, following `## Testing` below. Add tests as needed.
7. **Commit** with a one-line conventional message (e.g. `fix: set GatewayReady false on error`), then push. Run these as separate commands, without inline variable assignments:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/commands/iterate/push-branch.sh <branch-name>
   ```
8. **Open a PR**: `gh pr create --title "<commit message>" --body "Closes #<N>"`.
9. **Watch CI**: `gh pr checks <PR> --watch`. Fix failures until all checks are green.
10. **Merge**, then delete the remote branch. Not `--delete-branch`: that also deletes the
    local branch and switches the checkout to the default, which cannot work from a
    worktree whose parent has the default branch checked out — which is where this step
    always runs. It fails with `fatal: 'main' is already checked out` *after* merging, so
    the error reads like a failed merge when the merge succeeded.
    ```bash
    gh pr merge <PR> --squash
    git push origin --delete <branch-name>
    ```
11. **Clean up.** This is the one step that leaves the worktree. Run the *main checkout's*
    copy of the script and pass the worktree path — not the copy inside the worktree, because
    bash holds its own source file open while running it. On NFS, unlinking an open file
    leaves a `.nfs*` placeholder that cannot be removed until bash exits, so the worktree
    self-deleting its own script fails with `Device or resource busy` and the directory
    survives. Then delete the local branch, which `git worktree remove` leaves behind.
    ```bash
    cd <main checkout>
    bash .claude/commands/iterate/remove-worktree.sh <worktree-path>
    git branch -D <branch-name>
    ```
12. **Close the issue**:
    ```bash
    gh issue comment <N> --body "<resolution details>"
    gh issue edit <N> --remove-label "in-progress"
    gh issue close <N>
    ```
13. **Update `.claude/MEMORY.md`** if it exists and something is worth remembering for the next run (it's not a changelog). Then **stop**.

## Testing

Mirror the two PR CI jobs in `.github/workflows/test.yaml` — `image-test` and
`chart-lint`:

- `make test` — builds the image and runs coding-runtime's conformance suite in
  `adapter` mode. The suite is extracted from the image under test, so the checks
  always match the runtime being checked, and it runs the container the way the
  operator does (read-only root, uid 1000, all capabilities dropped) — a failure
  here is a failure in-cluster. Needs Docker.
- `make lint-chart` — `helm lint chart` plus `helm template opencode chart`, the
  same pair the `chart-lint` job runs.
- There is **no linter and no unit-test suite** here. This repo is a thin layer over
  the base, so CI correctness is exactly those two jobs; do not go looking for a
  third.
- `runtime.json` and `emit.mjs` are **verbatim copies** of upstream
  `examples/opencode/`. Do not edit them here — they move with the base, via
  `/update-dependencies`.
- The PR title must be a conventional commit (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`).
